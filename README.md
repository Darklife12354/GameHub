# RetroGames

A repository of retro games for the Gameboy, Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance, and Super Mario 64. Relive the nostalgia of classic gaming with our collection of timeless titles.

## How to Play

1. Visit the [RetroGames website](https://retrogamesv1.netlify.app/) or clone the repository to your local machine. (But you have to run it through a local server!)
2. Start playing and relive the magic of retro gaming!

Please note I don't have all games but I will keep adding new ones.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to contact me through the website's contact page.

Enjoy your retro gaming experience!
